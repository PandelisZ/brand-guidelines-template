## About the Structure
You only need to edit the "src" folder. This stands for "source"
There are the folders: 
-*bin* – mostly ignore this, unless you're changing the guidelines design & functionality
-*brand-files* – this is where all the deliverables are stored - logos, font files, packages, email signatures, etc
-*guidelines* – this is the content of the guidelines page.  This allows you to write information about the deliverables and add photos, sample content, etc
